Hello Distinguished Guests!

This console app is brought to you by Python

Simply slide into the project folder where we've downloaded our files.

type (or copy) python3 lbb.py 

voila!

It will prompt you to make an entry, that entry will be based on a date and a note. 

The date and note are verified (actual date/length of note)

The entry will then be saved to a file and printed to the screen 

This is a simple master loop that saves to an external file with some expanded if/elif work

*This project is a work in progress due shortly
