Hello Distinguished Guests!

This console app is brought to you by Python

Simply slide into the project folder where we've downloaded our files.

type (or copy) python3 lbb.py 

voila!

It will prompt you to make an entry, that entry will be based on a date and a note. 

The date and note are verified (actual date/length of note)

The entry will then be saved to a file and your most recent entry printed to the screen 

##### Requirements Used For Project

**While Loop**
    The master while loop is how the whole entry is made and processed

**Create a class, create object, populate with data**
    We have the Entry class which is the basis for the entry, the day and note are saved...

**Implement a log...**
    Day and note are saved to a seperate txt file
    Invalid entries will kick back the loop


Thank you for taking the time to grade my project, and all the hard work you do for Code Louisville.
